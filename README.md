# UW-Machine-Learning---Classification
Machine learning projects using classification models( regularized logistic regression, CART, random forest, boosted models)

### Projects
### 1. Sentiment analysis for Amazon product review: Use NLP to generate features from review text and create classification models which predict positive/negative sentiment from input features (review text, user profile).
### 2. Loan Default Prediction on lending club data: predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank.

* Implement classification model (logistic regression model, decision trees, RF, boosting, stochastic gradient ascent) on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks 
* Handling missing data  
* Evaluate models using metrics (precision and recall, F1 score, ROC, AUC)
